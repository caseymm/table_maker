## Instructions

More to come in this section soon, but to get you started...

1. ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt``` This is going to install xlrd, which you'll need to ingest the excel file data.

2. Run: ```$ python create.py ```

The rest should be fairly self explanatory since it prompts you to answer questions based on the types of data that it recognizes. Again, this is still rather buggy and is definitely still a work in progress, but it is usable.
